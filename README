A simulated shell for education purposes and learning C++

Most of the code was provided by the instructor and then modified as
part of the assignment.

Changes made:

main.cpp:
   added a helper function that checks to see if the current command was
   commented, executed on every command before any of the functions are
   called.

inode.cpp:
   TODO

commands.cpp:
   TODO
